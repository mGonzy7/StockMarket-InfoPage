      <p>The stock market is a place where investors buy and sell shares of publicly traded companies. It operates through exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq, allowing companies to raise capital and investors to own a piece of businesses.</p>
      <p>Stock prices fluctuate based on supply and demand, company earnings, economic conditions, and investor sentiment. If more people want to buy a stock than sell it, the price goes up—and if more people sell than buy, the price goes down.</p>

      <p>Stocks Represent Ownership in a Company – When you buy a stock, you become a shareholder, meaning you own a fraction of that company. This ownership gives you potential benefits such as price appreciation, dividends (if offered), and even voting rights in shareholder meetings for some stocks. Your investment grows as the company becomes more valuable.</p>
      <p>Stocks Offer Growth Potential but Come with Risk – Stocks have historically provided higher long-term returns compared to other investments like bonds or savings accounts. However, they are subject to market volatility, meaning their prices can rise and fall based on company performance, economic conditions, and investor sentiment. Successful investing often requires patience and a long-term perspective.</p>

        <p>Dividends Provide Passive Income to Investors – Some companies share their profits with shareholders through dividends, typically paid quarterly. Investors who focus on dividend-paying stocks can generate a steady income stream, which is especially useful for retirees or those looking for reliable cash flow.</p>
        <p>Dividend Growth Stocks Can Lead to Compounding Wealth – Some companies not only pay dividends but also increase them annually. These are known as dividend growth stocks. Reinvesting dividends allows investors to buy more shares, leading to a compounding effect where future dividends grow even larger. This strategy can significantly boost wealth over time.</p>

      <article>
        <p>Tax-Advantaged Investment Accounts Can Boost Long-Term Wealth – Accounts like 401(k)s, IRAs, and Roth IRAs offer tax benefits that help investors grow their money faster. A 401(k) allows contributions to be made pre-tax, reducing taxable income, while a Roth IRA grows tax-free, meaning you don’t pay taxes when withdrawing money in retirement. These accounts encourage long-term investing.</p>
        <p>Brokerage Accounts Offer Flexibility but Come with Taxes – Unlike retirement accounts, a regular brokerage account lets you invest freely in stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, and options without penalties for withdrawals. However, any profits (capital gains) are taxable, and you may also pay taxes on dividends received. Despite this, brokerage accounts provide full access to your money without waiting until retirement.</p>

      <article>
        <p>Call and Put Options Provide Strategic Investment Opportunities – A call option gives an investor the right (but not the obligation) to buy a stock at a predetermined price before a set expiration date, while a put option gives the right to sell. Options are often used to hedge risks, generate income, or make speculative trades on stock movements.</p>
        <p>Options Have an Expiration Date and Can Become Worthless – Unlike stocks, options contracts expire on a set date. If the market price of the underlying stock doesn’t move in the anticipated direction before expiration, the option can become worthless, resulting in a total loss of the premium paid. This makes options riskier than traditional stock investing, but they also offer potential for higher rewards when used correctly.</p>
